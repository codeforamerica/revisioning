# ReVisioning
Tracking and updating the recommendation &amp; implementation of the Network ReVisioning project

## Executive Summary
This full draft of the Network’s ReVisioning Recommendation is necessarily long and detailed so that Code for America as an organization can develop the targeted support needed to sustain the change and transitions to its system that the draft describes.
This doesn’t make it easy reading for the busy Brigade member or non-Brigade volunteer. Here’s a quick rundown of our current experiences and what we hope can change or improve with the Recommendation’s implementation:

### Where Do We Start Making Changes?
We start with developing better ways of relating to one another: nonprofit employee to Network volunteer, Brigade leader to member, Brigade members to non-Brigade volunteers, and our community to those we offer our tools and resources.
Our potential to negatively impact one another, to negatively impact communities we hope to help, can be lessened when we as a group exercise empathy in actionable, applicable ways. As a practice, small, guided group conversations develop this nuanced understanding of one another best.
The Network Team recently partnered with Tribeless, who host #EmpathyCircles, as a way of introducing this concept to the volunteer network. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to how we build empathy as a skill, but that is one way to start.
The other way to involve yourself with empathy practices is through our own peer-to-peer team’s choices for connecting through conversation. Members of our Network can request time, or join the team to help how we develop this necessary part of our work together.

## Introduction
Over the last 10 months, our Network community has asked big questions: What is our role in the world?  Where do we have the most impact? What do we need to succeed? After engaging hundreds of volunteers in peer-to-peers interviews, surveys, forums, mural sessions and more, we believe we have answers. 
This recommendation will outline our proposal for the purpose of the Code for America network community, its goals, primary strategies, and resources needed for success. It’s simultaneously ambitious and pragmatic, presented with significant input and feedback from the Network Community itself. 

### High Level, Thematic Overview
Deep desire for respect and parity.

Code for America’s volunteer members and their work on the frontlines of technology and community development seek to be recognized as peers in importance,  impact, and investment in relation to the members of the nonprofit organization and the work it performs on the national stage. This applies to Brigade and non-Brigade volunteers. 

Appetite for community impact and democractic experimentation. 

The Network community’s “DNA” is one that shows up for local community and community partners first and foremost -- both in terms of where we apply our skills and power and who we hold ourselves accountable to. Through ReVisioning, we rediscovered our propensity and strong desire for democractic experimentation and participatory processes, illuminating a deep desire to model, practice, and continue to redefine accessible engagement and decision making. 
Need for stronger spaces to organize talent pools in an interconnected network, learn from one another, and facilitate new relationships. 

Through this recommendation, we will propose creating more formal and functional spaces where community leaders and Code for America peers work and learn together. This includes spaces and structures to distribute our volunteer and staff capacity effectively, enhancing how distinct programs relate to one another (e.g. Brigades, Community Fellowship, GetYourRefund), and enriching our capabilities by providing trainings and a curriculum that defines and operationalizes our values and craft as a Code for America community. 
Desire for stronger frameworks and guidance to respond to community-led interests and drive impact, and resourcing those efforts. 

As a network, we need more resources, guidance, and frameworks on identifying and responding to community needs -- locally and nationally. This will also require additional human resources, financial resources, and new mechanisms for distribution of those resources that reflect our priorities and values. We aim to pilot new democratic decision-making practices within the Network, and create new fundraising streams through models of Network membership and partnership.

Need for clearer roles, responsibilities, decision-making, and support structures. 

A key component of equitable practices is to make the implicit, explicit. We need more explicit articulations of the roles within and across our community, responsibilities embedded within those roles, clarity of decision-making, and clearly articulated support structures to meet our needs. We anticipate this will also be a critical component of the implementation plan to bring the following recommendations to life.
